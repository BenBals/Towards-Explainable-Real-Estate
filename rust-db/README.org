* Development Environment
** Nix
The easiest way to get a development environment is to simply call `nix-shell` in this folder (not the git root!).
** TODO Rustup
*** Additional Dependencies
Ensure you have the following dependencies available:
- [[https://www.openssl.org/][OpenSSL]]

* Coverage
For every commit that reaches the `cargo-test` job, a coverage report is generated. See the job output for the link.
* Docs
We write docs for the project. You can view them as beautiful HTML.
** Local
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
cargo doc --open
#+END_SRC

** Interwebs
*** [[https://wasletztepreis-bp.de/rust-db-docs/master/common][Master]] and other branches
The docs for every branch, which has had a commit in the last 30 days, will be available at static URLS of the form

#+BEGIN_SRC
https://wasletztepreis-bp.de/rust-db-docs/[BRANCH_NAME]/common
#+END_SRC

We also keep certain links in the readme, as they might be especially useful:
